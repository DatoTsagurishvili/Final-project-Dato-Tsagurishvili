                <h1>Quality of Air</h1>
                    
                <p> Trees produce oxygen when they produce their food through photosynthesis. In addition during this process trees also use carbon dioxide in the air and reduce its concentrations in the atmosphere, points out BBC-GCSE Bitesize. This process regulates and maintains the carbon cycle. This is the reason cutting trees leads to global warming. Trees can also remove pollutants in the air. For example, when forests are cut down to make way for farms, many nutrients in soil are reduced, as their cycle is broken. This affects the number of soil bacteria. Adding chemical fertilizers further kills beneficial micro-organisms that decompose compost and make nutrients available for crops, or break down harmful compounds. This ends in dramatically decreasing soil fertility even though high concentrations of chemical fertilizers are added, and reducing crop yields explains FAO. So, the consequences are more costly for the economy.

                 <h1>Threat of Environmental Degradation
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The deterioration of environment, often referred to as environmental degradation, threatens the earth's natural resources such as clean water supply, fossil fuels for energy, and food supply. This also occurs when resources are over-exploited and leads to a disruption in normal functioning in an area. Global warming caused by climate change can result in a rise in sea levels submerging coastal land, and thereby reducing and harming habitats of animals living by the coast as well as human settlements, explains the Department of Ecology in Washington State. Global warming also melts polar caps and endangers polar bears and other arctic wildlife; furthermore, the ice caps keep the earth cooler by reflecting solar light back, according to World Wide Fund for Nature. All goods and services used by humanity come directly or indirectly from the earth and its environment. So it is perhaps not a surprise that an international scientific study (pg. 1) in 2012 estimated that goods and services from ecosystems worldwide were worth $125 trillion per year. However, the value of the environment is more than this monetary worth as it is, so far, the only planet that can support life. Many experts believe some of the harm the planet has suffered can be reversed. The challenge is getting enough people to take drastic enough action to make a difference in a lifetime.
